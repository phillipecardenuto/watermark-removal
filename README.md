# PDF Watermark Remover

**Removes 'RETRACTED' watermarks from Academic PDF articles.**

This software has three levels of aggressivity; as higher the level more damage it can cause to the final result.\
However, even for the maximum level of aggressivity, the images/photos embedded in the PDF would still be preserved. 
  

-- **Level 1:**
    All PDF stream resources that explicitly contain the information saying that it is a Watermark are removed.

-- **Level 2 (Default):**
    All Watermarks from level 1 and graphical element that appear more than once along the PDF pages are removed.
    In addition, all 'RETRACTED' words are also removed.
    For some few PDFs, this aggressivity level could remove the entire text from a Page.

-- **Level 3:**
    All Watermarks from levels 1 and 2 and all graphical elements are removed from the PDF.
    The only chance for the Retraction Watermark not to be removed with such a level of aggressivity is either the PDF is corrupted or the Retraction Watermark embedded as an Image File.
    In this case, we will preserve the Watermark since this function is designed not to erase any image/photo from the PDF.



### Quick Start

Environment used to run the project:

- Python >= 3.8
- PyPDF4, PyMuPDF

There is a requirements.txt that can help with the environment.
``` bash
$ pip install -f requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run Watermark remover
``` bash
$ python PDFSolvent -i <PDF-input> -o <PDF-output> -m [mode of aggressivity] 
```



## Cases of Success


### 1: The Watermark is explicit informed in each Page-Resource-XObject field:

Using [RUPS](https://itextpdf.com/en/blog/technical-notes/rups-looking-inside-your-pdfs) from IText©

-------

### 2:  The Watermark is a word that overlays the PDF body Text:

### 3. The Watermark is generated by Graphic Path Construction

## Case of Failure

A case of failure occurs when the PDF is corrupted, and the 'RETRACTED' word is split into subwords along the PDF stream.

For this case, we recommend to download another version of the article and try again.
